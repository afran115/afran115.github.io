        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I’m Anthony Franco, an English major with a passion for storytelling, language, and the impact of effective communication. Whether it’s analyzing literature, media compelling narratives, or refining content for clarity and impact, words have always shaped the way we understand the world.
I’m currently in my final year of my Bachelor’s in English at the University of California, Riverside, where I’ve developed my analytical, writing, and research skills. My coursework has covered everything from classic and contemporary literature to forms of art and creative writing. Not limited to my school, I’ve applied my skills in professional settings, refining my ability to write with adaptability.
I’ve contributed to various projects, including resource newsletters, academic seminars, and web content, ensuring that each piece is clear, concise, and suited to its audience. My experience also includes proofreading and revising written work to improve readability and flow.
In addition, I’ve been involved in a few administrative support roles, where communication is key. I’ve worked with students and faculty, developing study materials, and organizing information to enhance accessibility. These experiences have strengthened my ability to explain complex ideas, collaborate with others, and refine content for clarity and impact.
At the heart of my work is a love for communication and language. I enjoy exploring how words connect people, whether through creative writing or art. My goal is to continue refining my skills in writing, editing, and content development, with a focus on making ideas engaging and available to a wide audience.
I believe that accessible communication is an essential tool in every field, and I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my skills in meaningful ways.
